Create a level, using primitive objects (Cube, Cylinder, Sphere, ETC (Not planes, you son of bitch)
Re-assemble, New Michael. 
-- Make sure feet at 0, but model is at 0.5. 
-- Attatch the script PlayerMovement,to Michael, not Model. 
-- Give mike color, via material. As well plane - and create a new material, to your obstacles, however many you want per unique obstacle if you're cool guy.
-- Level must be entirely playable, adjust the position of each obstacle slowly going up, feel free to make a whole ass maze, must be solvable. 

Challenge extra:

Adjust camera angle, for unique perspective, but make sure you can always see the player if you do. (if he falls behind a wall we need to be able to still see whats happening, so we dont get locked)
